Narrated from Brawne’s view on the romance, the movie not only uncovers the evolution of their young romance, but traces Fanny’s introduction into and fascination with Keats’s world of poetry, starting with indifference and ending with heartfelt involvement. At the time the two people meet in 1818 once Keats has properly set himself up in the literary world. However, his job does not enable him the financial means to marry. With this knowledge, Brawne’s interaction with Keats is stymied, so she throws herself into his world by feigning a fascination with poetry. Keats’s poetry counts among some of the greatest works in British literature."},{"wrapperType":"track","kind":"feature-movie","collectionId":1476858599,"trackId":379387379,"artistName":"George Cukor","collectionName":"A Star is Born 3 Film Collection","trackName":"A Star Is Born (1954)","collectionCensoredName":"A Star is Born 3 Film Collection","trackCensoredName":"A Star Is Born (1954)","collectionArtistId":199257486,"collectionArtistViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/au/artist/warner-bros-entertainment-inc/199257486?uo=4","collectionViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/au/movie/a-star-is-born-1954/id379387379?uo=4","trackViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/au/movie/a-star-is-born-1954/id379387379?uo=4","previewUrl":"https://video-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/Video117/v4/e3/30/a3/e330a3a7-1b95-8882-e5b7-3c2e5589a6ef/mzvf_6071079475211988020.640x246.h264lc.U.p.m4v","artworkUrl30":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video118/v4/96/2d/f6/962df6dc-0b59-5ac9-a55a-d48b1cc99384/source/30x30bb.jpg","artworkUrl60":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video118/v4/96/2d/f6/962df6dc-0b59-5ac9-a55a-d48b1cc99384/source/60x60bb.jpg","artworkUrl100":"https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Video118/v4/96/2d/f6/962df6dc-0b59-5ac9-a55a-d48b1cc99384/source/100x100bb.jpg","collectionPrice":14.99,"trackPrice":14.99,"trackRentalPrice":4.99000,"collectionHdPrice":14.99000,"trackHdPrice":14.99000,"trackHdRentalPrice":4.99000,"releaseDate":"1955-01-01T08:00:00Z","collectionExplicitness":"notExplicit","trackExplicitness":"notExplicit","discCount":1,"discNumber":1,"trackCount":3,"trackNumber":2,"trackTimeMillis":10549727,"country":"AUS","currency":"AUD","primaryGenreName":"Drama","contentAdvisoryRating":"M","longDescription":"A Star is Born marked Judy Garland's return to movies after a four-year absence, director George Cukor's first musical and first color film, and a showcase for great Harold Arden/Ira Gershwin songs in state-of-the-art stereo.

She catches the eye of Norman Maine (James Mason), an alcoholic actor in career decline. Their intense love transforms them both. Only one will survive Hollywood's slings and arrows. Shortened in response to exhibitor complaints after its premiers, the movie underwent one rebirth in 1983 when film historian Ronald Haver found almost all the cut sequences and supervised a reconstruction to near its original length.
